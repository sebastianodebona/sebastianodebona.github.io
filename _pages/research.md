I am broadly interested in how population-level features– like population dynamics and the spatial ecology of a species– emerge from the sum of individual-level traits. My research involves quantitative approaches and spans several study systems and questions. Below is a quick summary of my main interests.

## Biological Invasions in a Changing World

The rate at which invasive alien species are introduced in new locations is increasing, often threatening local biodiversity and national economies. If our goal is to predict and prevent the establishment and spread of invasive populations, it is crucial to understand the drivers of these processes. To tackle this, we can use statistical models fitted over large datasets to understand broad correlation patterns between ecological features and life history traits and behaviors. We can study, for instance, how temperature affects the growth and development of organisms; how resource availability affects survival, fecundity, and dispersal; how predation regulates population size. This approach grants us not only basic knowledge of the species but also the ability to parameterize mechanistic mathematical models. A bottom-up approach, where mechanisms are used to infer large-scale behaviors at the population level, is best suited to predict the behavior of a system in a set of circumstances that we have not yet witnessed. For instance, based on our knowledge of how individual traits depend on ecological features, we can ask how the likelihood of establishment will change as temperature rises due to climate change, or as hosts become more/less available due to new invasive species being introduced. A large chunk of my research involves working with the models described above.

The spotted lanternfly (*Lycorma delicatula*) is a generalist, sap-feeding planthopper that was accidentally introduced in the United States in Berks County, PA in 2014. Since then, it has spread through the Northeastern US, coming into the spotlight for its damaging impact on economically important tree species such as grapevine, maple, and walnut (you can read about it [here](https://extension.psu.edu/spotted-lanternfly) and [here](https://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Plants_Land_Water/PlantIndustry/Entomology/spotted_lanternfly/SpottedLanternflyAlert/Pages/default.aspx)). With [Prof. Matt Helmus](https://www.iecolab.org/matthew-r-helmus/), Stephanie Lewkiewicz, and Prof. Benni Seibold, we developed a first-principle Partial Differential Equation model to predict the chances of establishment and spread of spotted lanternfly throughout the United States.

## Harnessing data science to aid management actions

Innovation in data collection techniques, and the involvement of the public through community-science initiatives, allows data to be collected at an unprecedented pace. This is especially true for species that are 1) of economic importance such as invasive pest species, prompting news media to cover them and local government to publicize their impact; 2) easy to identify without extensive scientific training
