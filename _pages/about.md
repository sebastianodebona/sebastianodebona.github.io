I am an evolutionary ecologist who studies the drivers of establishment and spread of invasive populations. My current Postdoc position at the [iEcoLab, Temple University](https://www.iecolab.org) focuses on understanding and predicting the invasion of the Spotted Lanternfly (*Lycorma delicatula*) in the United States. My research involves the handling of large datasets, and the development of statistical and mathematical models.
