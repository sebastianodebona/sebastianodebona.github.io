I am broadly interested in how population-level features (like population dynamics and the spatial ecology of a species) emerge from the sum of individual-level traits. My research spans several study systems and questions. Below is a summary of my interests.

## Species Invasions in a Changing World

The rate at which invasive alien species are introduced in new locations is increasing, often threatening local biodiversity and national economies. If our goal is to predict and prevent the establishment and spread of invasive populations, it is crucial to better understand the drivers of these processes. To tackle this, we can use statistical models fitted over large datasets to understand broad patterns of correlation between ecological features and life history traits and behaviors. We can study, for instance, how temperature affects the growth and development of organisms; how resource availability affects survival, fecundity, and dispersal; how predation regulates population size. This approach grants us not only knowledge that is helpful in of itself, but also the ability to parameterize mechanistic mathematical models. A bottom-up approach, where mechanisms are used to infer large-scale behaviors at the population level, is best suited to predict the behavior of a system in a set of circumstances that we have not yet witnessed. For instance, based on our knowledge of how individual traits depend on ecological features, we can ask how the likelihood of establishment will change as temperature rises due to climate change, or as hosts become more/less available due to new invasive species being introduced. A large chunk of my research involves working with the models described above.


### The spread of Spotted Lanternfly in the US

The spotted lanternfly (*Lycorma delicatula*) is a generalist, sap-feeding planthopper that was accidentally introduced in Berks County, PA in 2014, and has since spread through the Northeastern US. This bug has come into the spotlight, since it causes damage to economically important tree species such as grapevine, maple, and walnut (you can read about it [here](https://extension.psu.edu/spotted-lanternfly) and [here](https://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Plants_Land_Water/PlantIndustry/Entomology/spotted_lanternfly/SpottedLanternflyAlert/Pages/default.aspx)).

 Together with [Prof. Matt Helmus](https://www.iecolab.org/matthew-r-helmus/), Stephanie Lewkiewicz, and Prof. Benni Seibold, I am currently developing first-principle Partial Differential Equation models to predict the chances of establishment and spread of spotted lanternfly throughout the United States.
